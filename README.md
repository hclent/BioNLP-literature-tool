# BioNLP-literature-tool

Under construction 

Pipeline: information retrieval --> natural language processing --> topic modeling (and clustering) --> data visualization --> web interface 

A Google Doc presentation of my pipeline can be found here:

#Information retrieval#
Entrez_IR.py in '1_info_retrieval' takes a pubmed ID and outputa txt files for all of the publications citing the original pubmedID. This code uses NCBI's API. These txt documents undergo NLP.

#NLP#
preprocess.py uses University of Arizona's' CluLab's NLP tools for tokenization, lemmitization, named entity recognition, etc. 

#Topic Modeling / Clustering#
I am trying several topic modeling and clustering algorithms, including LDA, LSA, and K-means. 

#Data Visualization#
JSON for D3 data visualization is generated by some of the topic models, and Plotly scatterplots are generated in k-means clustering. These can be seen in the web interface. 

#Web Interface#
Please see my repository called "Webdev for bioNLP lit tool"
https://github.com/hclent/Webdev-for-bioNLP-lit-tool

#Graveyard#
This is where I am keeping depreciated code that I am no longer using for my project but that I think is still valuable for the github community :)
