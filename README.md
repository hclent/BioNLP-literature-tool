#Information retrieval#
Entrez_IR.py This code uses NCBI's API.

#NLP#
preprocess.py uses University of Arizona's' CluLab's NLP tools for tokenization, lemmitization, named entity recognition, etc. 

#Topic Modeling / Clustering#
I am trying several topic modeling and clustering algorithms, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and K-means clustering. 


#Web Interface#
Please see my repository called "Webdev for bioNLP lit tool"

#Graveyard#
This is where I am keeping depreciated code that I am no longer using for my project but that I think is still valuable for the github community :)
