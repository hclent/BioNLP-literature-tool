For the subset of genes that were first\n                            identified by mutant phenotype and are syntenically retained\n                            N\u200a=\u200a102.', 'Our manual proofing of the classical maize gene list shows that, as tempting as\n                    it may be to rely primarily on inexpensive in silico annotation\n                    techniques, manual structural annotation provided a significant amount of\n                    important information to B73_refgen2. Tools are available that allow interested\n                    researchers to proof and improve the structural annotations of their favorite\n                    genes [22].\n                    Having those improvements incorporated into official genome annotations would\n                    benefit the entire community.', 'The idea that genetic collinearity among the grasses could be used to accelerate\n                    the research across the whole family is a venerable one [1], [2], [23]. Enthusiasm for this\n                    concept of treating the grasses as a single genetic system waned as the\n                    sequencing of multiple grass genomes demonstrated that a significant fraction of\n                    transcribed genes are not syntenically retained across species, limiting the\n                    benefits of cross-species mapping and trait dissection. Our finding that\n                    37% of maize genes supported by full-length cDNA are not retained at a\n                    syntenic position in other grass species, and almost 50% of cDNA\n                    supported genes apparently inserted into their present locations prior to\n                    divergence of the BEP clade, represented by both rice and brachypodium, is in\n                    agreement with previous studies. Research in arabidopsis, using papaya as an\n                    outgroup, estimated that half of all annotated genes in that species belonged to\n                    a “gray” genome of genes which had transposed into nonsyntenic\n                    positions within the last 70 million years [24]. A recent study in\n                    Drosophila found that knockouts of recently inserted – within the last 35\n                    million years – and ancient syntenically conserved genes produced lethal\n                    phenotypes at statistically similar rates [25].', 'Genes belonging to the gray genome of maize are essentially unexplored. The genes\n                    of greatest interest historically seem to be precisely those that are retained\n                    in the same syntenic position in the genomes of all grass species. It may be\n                    that, in plants, genes essential for day to day function, such as those involved\n                    in key biochemical and developmental pathways, are by definition less likely to\n                    transpose or, when they transpose, are less likely to rise to fixation within a\n                    species. A small but significant number of mutant genes in maize were identified\n                    using map-based cloning approaches relying on rice synteny, prior to the\n                    publication of the maize genome. While map-based cloning and comparison of maize\n                    to rice certainly did occur, we think it unlikely that this explanation accounts\n                    for the magnitude of our results.', 'The techniques used in this paper allowed us to identify with high confidence,\n                    lost or transposed genes by first identifying a predicted orthologous syntenic\n                    location in the target grass genome. Even the genes which are not retained in\n                    all species can be a starting point for hypothesis driven research, a use we\n                    support via Gevo links to enable quick visual comparisons of orthologs or\n                    predicted locations in multiple grass species (Supplemental\n                        Information S1). For example, c1 and pl1 are two homeologous maize\n                    genes that regulate the biosynthesis of anthocyanin. Both genes have been\n                    studied extensively by the maize genetics community. A syntenic co-ortholog of\n                    the two genes is retained in the genomes of both sorghum and rice. However the\n                    gene is absent from orthologous region of the brachypodium genome (Figure S1)\n                    which prompted us to investigate further and find the gene was not present\n                    anywhere in the brachypodium genome (Figure S2). We conclude from this brief\n                    research foray that this portion of the anthocyanin biosynthetic regulatory\n                    pathway may be significantly different or completely absent in brachypodium,\n                    opening avenues for further research.', 'A bias towards maize1 for the classical maize genes was expected given the\n                    greater total number of retained genes present in that subgenome. However, when\n                    we examined the subset of the classical maize gene list identified by a mutant\n                    phenotype prior to cloning, the bias of this dataset towards the dominant\n                    subgenome – maize1 – was significantly greater than could be\n                    explained by the difference in total gene numbers between the two subgenomes.\n                    Interestingly this bias is also statistically significant for genes with a\n                    retained homeolog on the opposite, homologous subgenome, maize2. Since there is\n                    one gene copy present in each subgenome for this class of gene, a\n                        priori evidence of gene function, the expectation was that\n                    mutations of either copy would be about equally likely to produce a mutant\n                    phenotype. This was not the case.', 'Rather, our finding that maize1 is the preferred location of genes with mutant\n                    phenotypes even when a homeologous duplicate is present suggests that the loss\n                    of maize1 copies may be more likely to result in visible impacts of the sort\n                    which might catch the eye of researchers, or farmers, in the field. As impacts\n                    on plant morphology visible to researchers are likely to have a pronounced\n                    impact on plant fitness, this finding is certainly consistent with our\n                    previously published hypothesis that the deletion of a gene from maize1 is more\n                    likely to be selected against than the deletion of the same gene from maize2\n                        [15].', 'The corollary is even more interesting: knockout phenotypes do not appear to be\n                    behaving as if gene function was buffered by a duplicate copy of the same gene\n                    expressed in the same cells. For the moment, our working hypothesis is that\n                    maize1 gene copies have predominantly retained the ancestral function of the\n                    gene in the pre-duplication ancestor of maize, leaving maize2 copies free to\n                    potentially adopt new, or less essential functions. This prediction is fully\n                    testable on a gene-by-gene basis through investigation of the function of\n                    orthologous genes we identify in the closely related and unduplicated species\n                    sorghum.', 'This pilot study demonstrates the usefulness of traditional genetics data in the\n                    genomics era, and the importance of model species like maize with long histories\n                    of genetic investigation. A large number of morphological mutants in maize\n                    remain uncloned. The ability to identify high confidence orthologs in all grass\n                    species with sequenced genomes combined with the unrivaled economic and\n                    ecological significance of the Poaceae means investigation of a gene or gene\n                    family in any one of these species can quickly benefit researchers working\n                    around the world to answer a wide range of questions in different grass species.\n                    We hope that the tools, datasets, and links provided here (Supplemental\n                        Information S1), as well as our preliminary findings, will support\n                    continued insights based on pan-grass comparative genetics.', 'Classical maize genes were identified from the list of maize loci maintained by\n                MaizeGDB [5],\n                    [6] and\n                include genes with associated GenBank sequence records with greater than three\n                referencing papers in the database, additional cloned genes with known mutant\n                phenotypes, as well as genes added after soliciting community input.
