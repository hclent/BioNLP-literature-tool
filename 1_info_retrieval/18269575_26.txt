Conserved noncoding sequences\n(CNSs) in plants are much shorter, and it\nhas been difficult to detect conservation among distantly related genomes. In this\narticle, we show not only that CNS sequences\ncan be detected throughout the eudicot clade of flowering plants, but also that a\nsubset of 37 CNSs can be found in all\nflowering plants (diverging ∼170 million years ago). These CNSs are functionally similar to vertebrate\nCNEs, being highly associated with\ntranscription factor and development genes and enriched in transcription factor\nbinding sites. Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding\nRNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing–associated SR genes.\nDifferences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect\ndifferences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to\ntolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their\nfar greater fecundity compared with vertebrates.', 'conserved noncoding element', 'long identical multispecies element', 'million years ago', 'conserved noncoding sequence', 'high-scoring segment pair', 'untranslated region', 'gene ontology', 'double-stranded RNA', 'ultraconserved-like element', 'whole-genome duplication']
