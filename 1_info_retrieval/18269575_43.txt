WGD and fractionation are particularly prevalent in flowering plants (Soltis et al., 2009), where the cycle of the two processes also involves the constant excision of excess non-coding DNA (Eckard, 2001; Freeling et al., 2012), a major difference between these organisms and other evolutionary domains, such as the mammals.', 'Gene order disruption follows from the partly random choice of which of the two copies is deleted, i.e. which of two homeologous chromosomes retains the remaining single copy of the gene. This process was first hypothesized by Wolfe and Shields in their 1997 demonstration of the ancient WGD of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wolfe and Shields, 1997), suggesting ‘… this is the result of random deletion of individual duplicated genes from one or other chromosome subsequent to the initial duplication of the whole region’. This loss pattern was further highlighted years later by the comparison of the S. cerevisiae gene order with that of related diploid yeasts by Dietrich et al. (2004) and Kellis et al. (2004), who called it ‘interleaving’, while Freeling was coining the usage ‘fractionation’ in the context of plant genomics.', 'When a number of adjacent duplicate pairs lose a group of their redundant genes from one homeolog and another group from the other homeolog, as in Figure 1, methods for inferring the rearrangement distances between the WGD descendant T (referred to as an ‘ancient tetraploid’ despite being a present-day genome, long since re-diploidized) and an unduplicated sister genome D automatically infer that there are rearrangement breakpoints where adjacency no longer exists between the two groups of single-copy survivors. This artificially inflates the inferred number of reciprocal translocations and greatly exaggerates the overall amount of chromosomal rearrangement between the two sister genomes. The first goal of our work is to be able to computationally detect, characterize and correct for this impediment to the study of evolution.\nFig. 1.Fractionation leading to different adjacencies in diploid and ancient tetraploid\n', 'Fractionation leading to different adjacencies in diploid and ancient tetraploid', 'Key to our method is the identification and isolation of ‘fractionation intervals’, regions in both the ancient tetraploid and its sister diploid that have become entirely single copy and may or may not have been rearranged internally but have (so far) been unaffected by rearrangements exchanging genes from within the interval and genes external to the interval. The second goal of our work is to inventory these regions across the two genomes to that they can be studied quantitatively. The statistical properties of the intervals bear on current topics of interest in plant evolutionary genomics, whether duplicated genes are silenced or deleted one by one or through the deletion of longer stretches of DNA, whether a fractionation regions tends to lose genes largely from one of the homeologous chromosomal segments or equally from the two and on the question of subgenome dominance, i.e. whether any such bias toward one homeolog persists from the original WGD event and is unaffected by chromosome shuffling.', 'In this article, we focus on the evolutionary divergence of a genome after WGD compared with a related diploid. The mathematics of genome comparison at the level of gene order or conserved synteny blocks is well worked out [reviewed in (Fertin et al., 1974)] when the two genomes have identical complements of single-copy genes only, but the problem is more difficult when they have different gene complements or genes that occur two or more times in a genome. There are many approaches to the comparison of genomes with duplicates, as reviewed in (El-Mabrouk and Sankoff, 2012). These range from ‘guided genome halving’ where single-copy genes may simply be excluded from ancient tetraploid (Zheng et al., 2008) or included in an ad hoc way (Sankoff et al., 2009), through ‘duplication-loss’ models where the ordering of loss and duplication events is the focus (Marron et al., 2004), to the ‘exemplar method’ where it is the duplicate genes that are excluded or rather reduced to single-copy status in an optimal way before the comparison and everything in between (Sankoff, 1999). Although all of these are well motivated in particular contexts, they all invoke objective functions that are largely irrelevant to fractionation.', 'The central datum in genome comparison algorithms is generally the ‘gene adjacency’. Ideally, the genes are oriented, i.e. their 5’- and 3’-ends are distinguished, and when we speak of two genes being adjacent, we mean that the 3’-end of one is adjacent to the 5’-end of the next one, if they are on the same DNA strand or that their two 5’-ends (or two 3’-ends) are adjacent if they are on complementary strands. An adjacency is thus defined by two specific gene ends and not by two genes.', 'Decomposing a genome into its adjacencies, to take advantage of genome comparison algorithms, loses no information in the case of diploid genomes if all genes are present in only one copy, since then the genome is completely determined by its adjacencies. This equivalence between genomes and sets of adjacencies may break down when duplicate genes occur in large numbers. Nevertheless, in this article, we will use the adjacencies directly to bypass the arbitrary use of objective functions and other assumptions inherent in most comparison algorithms. In particular, it will be appropriate in the WGD-fractionation context to simply compare the sets of adjacencies that occur at least once in a genome as the relevant representation of that genome.', 'As a doubled genome evolves through genome rearrangement and/or fractionation, there is a direct effect on the inventory of oriented gene adjacencies. Initially, a new tetraploid and an unduplicated sister genome will have the exact same adjacencies, although these will have multiplicity 2 in the tetraploid. Over time, rearrangement will change the adjacencies in the diploid, without appreciably changing the total number of adjacencies. (This number can change only as a result of the rare events of chromosomal fission or fusion, whereas it does not change after the more frequent events of inversion or reciprocal translocation.) At the same time, in the tetraploid, both rearrangement and fractionation will add new adjacencies without necessarily losing the original ones, since an evolutionary event need only affect one gene copy or one homeolog at a time, leaving the other intact. Thus, the total number of different adjacencies in the diploid and the ancient tetraploid T, in excess of the number in the diploid D alone, measures the degree of evolutionary divergence.', 'We carried out simulations of the schema in Figure 2 to quantify the effect of rearrangement on the number of adjacencies, involving random chromosomal inversions and reciprocal translocations in the proportions 10:1. The simulations modeled a diploid with 24 000 genes randomly divided among 20 chromosomes. The two breakpoints of each rearrangement were chosen at random on the same chromosome for inversions, and on two randomly chosen chromosomes, for translocations. A separate series of simulations modeled the inversions as short (random inversion length drawn from a geometric distribution, with mean length of five genes) and unrestricted, with two random end points, in the proportion 20:1. The differences in the results between the two kinds of model were negligible in all analyses in this article, including the one in Section 4.4 later.\nFig. 2.Schema for simulation of divergence between an ancient tetraploid and a sister diploid\n', 'Schema for simulation of divergence between an ancient tetraploid and a sister diploid', 'All simulations were run 20 times, and their average values were plotted.

The genes deleted to form the ancient tetraploid were chosen entirely at random from the entire genome, under the constraint that once a gene was deleted, its duplicate could not be deleted in a later step. The solid lines in Figure 4 show the effect of increasing amounts of fractionation on the apparent amount of rearrangement, a gross distortion.\nFig. 4.Simulated increase in apparent rearrangement in an ancient tetraploid compared to a diploid sister genome, as a function of actual rearrangements r and number of deleted duplicate genes d.

This focuses on detecting and accounting for two homeologous regions of single-copy genes in the ancient tetraploid which contain no genes in common (as the genes concerned are single copy) but whose combined [or consolidated (Langham et al., 2004)] gene content is exactly the same as some contiguous region in the diploid. We call maximal regions like this Class 1 regions, in contrast to Class 2 regions, where there is only one region in the tetraploid which contains only, and exactly, the same single-copy genes as a region in the ancient tetraploid, but where there is sometimes clear adjacency evidence of where the duplicate copies of these genes were deleted, as in Figure 5. Classes 1 and 2 exhaust all the single-copy genes in the ancient tetraploid. The algorithm for detecting and listing these regions runs in linear time in the number of genes. Once the regions are identified, the three components of a Class 1 region are replaced by a new, labelled, dummy gene. Similarly, for the two components of a Class 2 region, with a third copy of the dummy gene placed whenever possible according to the afore-mentioned adjacency evidence.\nFig. 5.Arrow indicates positioning of third (empty) fractionation interval for genes 6,7 and 8, on the evidence of the positioning of these three genes between 5 and 9 in the diploid and on one homeologous chromosome\n', 'Arrow indicates positioning of third (empty) fractionation interval for genes 6,7 and 8, on the evidence of the positioning of these three genes between 5 and 9 in the diploid and on one homeologous chromosome', 'The two genomes, thus reduced by the replacement of single-copy genes by a lesser number of dummy genes, is then examined for excess adjacencies.', 'Note that the genes in this discussion are all oriented, i.e. their 5′-and 3′-ends are distinguished, and when we speak of two genes being adjacent, we mean that the 3′-end of one is adjacent to the 5′-end of the next one, if they are on the same DNA strand or that their two 5′-ends (or two 3′-ends) are adjacent if they are on complementary strands.

Other consolidation algorithms, with linear worst case running time, have been devised by J. Kováč (personal communication) and K. Jahn (personal communication).', 'The consolidation algorithm treats the fractionation intervals as identical units, one in the diploid and two in the tetraploid. In this way, it accounts not only for rearrangements which includes a whole interval in its scope but also for rearrangements which disrupt an interval, in that a fractionation involving such an interval will generally be automatically counted as two intervals, resulting in two virtual units instead of one. What the consolidation algorithm does not account for, however, are rearrangements occurring completely within one of the fractionation intervals.', 'To correct for this, within each fractionation regions, we first consider all the adjacencies in I1 and compare each I2 and, if necessary, I3, with I1. For the comparison, with I2, for example we delete the genes in I1 not in I2. We count only those a2 adjacencies in I2 not in the reduced I1.

Most rearrangements will not change the contents of any fractionation region. When most of the gene pairs have been reduced to single copy, fractionation regions will tend to be longer, especially if there have been few rearrangements. Then each new rearrangement is likely to disrupt a fractionation region, usually breaking it into two. These tendencies can be seen in Figure 8, where the fractionation regions for a genome with 15 000 out of 24 000 gene pairs reduced to single copies, are little affected by rearrangements. Where 21 000 of the pairs are thus reduced, the size of the fractionation regions is much more sensitive to rearrangements.\nFig. 8.Fractionation region size as a function of number of rearrangements\n', 'Fractionation region size as a function of number of rearrangements', 'In applying our method to the genome of poplar (Populus trichocarpa) (Tuskan et al., 2006), an ancient tetraploid, compared with diploid sister genomes, grapevine (Vitis vinifera) (Jaillon et al., 2007) and cacao (Theobroma cacao)1 (Argout et al., 2011), we discovered that the large majority, 70–90%, of the apparent rearrangements are actually attributable to fractionation. We also carried out matching simulations, with the same number of duplicate and single-copy genes, produced by random paralog deletion and a number of random rearrangements, mostly inversions, to produce the same number of excess adjacencies. Examining the consolidated regions detected by our algorithm, there are a number of regions much longer than those in the simulations (Fig. 9), suggesting a non-independence of deletion events affecting neighboring genes and clear tendency for genes to be deleted in one of the two homeologs, as would be predicted by the recent theory of subgenome dominance (Schnable et al., 2011): ‘Genes are disproportionately lost from one parental subgenome, the subgenome that is less expressed in the polyploid’.\nFig. 9.Size of Populus–Vitis fractionation regions compared with simulations matched for rearrangement and deletion rates.

In particular, we found eight regions that contained more than 15 genes in both comparisons; six of these pairs of comparisons had more than 15 genes in common; of most interest is that the common genes were 100% on only one homeolog in seven of the eight cases. This strongly suggests that there is a functional reason for these large sets of contiguous genes to be reduced to single-copy and for these copies to be retained on a single homeolog.', 'Although we have detected and measured substantial bias in the fractionation of ancient core eudicot tetraploids, without a gene-by-gene reconstruction of the ancestral chromosomes, we cannot as yet be sure that the bias is systematically in favor of one or other of the diploids contributing to the original polyploid. This dominance of one of the subgenomes has been demonstrated in the case of maize (Schnable et al., 2011), where it was also correlated to gene expression, patterns which persisted despite a number of genome rearrangement events disrupting the original synteny relations among genes.', 'An analytically advantageous feature of our analysis is that it partitions the rearrangements that have affected a tetraploid into those that have operated within a fractionation interval and those that have left these intervals intact, either because the intervals are outside the scope of the rearrangement or the interval is affected as a whole, without any effect internally. Of course, in the the history of the tetraploid there will have been some rearrangements that have involved elements both within and outside fractionation intervals, but these are rendered irrelevant and invisible to our analysis because their effect is simply to fragment the intervals into two or more new intervals and hence perpetuate the within-outside partitioning of the rearrangements.', 'One of the problems remaining with this work is the large number of genes that do not appear in any synteny block in the diploidtetraploid analysis of pairs of core eudicot genomes. This despite reducing the minimum block length as low as 2 in SynMap. Some of this is undoubtedly due to genes absent from one of the genomes, but much of it will be due to movement of genes out of their erstwhile homeologous contexts, by various processes (Wicker et al., 2010; Woodhouse et al., 2011).', 'In our simulations of geometric deletion events, we ‘marked’ some duplicate genes for deletion before carrying out the rearrangement step, and only actually deleted them afterward. This was for purposes of comparability of the results with the previous simulations where deletions followed rearrangements. Our goal in this marking was to allow a degree of switching between homeologous chromosomes during the deletion event, and no connection was assumed between two different events. However, this computational device could also be used to model subgenome dominance, by using two different p-values one for the dominant subgenome and a smaller value for the other subgenome. Marking becomes analogous to (lack of) methylation or to other epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can persist despite extensive genome rearrangement.', 'It will be of interest to explore the extensions of our treatment of fractionation to genomes descending from more complex polyploidization events than WGD. The plant genomes studied here, as well as all the other core eudicots, descend from an ancestral hexaploidization event (Jaillon et al., 2007). Extensive fractionation has left only a hundred or so triplicates intact and about a thousand duplicates, in Vitis and in cacao (Zheng et al., 2012). Many core eudicot angiosperm genomes have been sequenced but as of yet no sequence of a dicot that diverged before the hexaploidization event has been published, so that extensions of our procedure could be tested.', 'The authors thank Jakub Kováč for a number of valuable comments and suggestions during the work reported in this study and Eric Lyons for guidance to current trends in subgenome research.', 'Funding: This research was supported, in part, by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). D.S. holds the Canada Research Chair in Mathematical Genomics.', 'Conflict of Interest: none declared.', '1Data were drawn from CoGe (Lyons and Freeling, 2008; Lyons et al., 2008) and processed using the SynMap procedure, with a 2:1 syntenic depth setting to account for the ancient tetraploidy of poplar, and minimum syntenic block length 2 (to avoid the excessive noise with minimum size 1 but capturing more orthologies than with higher minimum sizes).']
