The stage of embryo arrest, however, can be influenced by genetic background. To identify genes responsible for improved growth in the absence of chloroplast translation, we examined seedling responses of different Arabidopsis accessions on spectinomycin, an inhibitor of chloroplast translation, and crossed the most tolerant accessions with embryo-defective mutants disrupted in chloroplast ribosomal proteins generated in a sensitive background. The results indicate that tolerance is mediated by ACC2, a duplicated nuclear gene that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase to plastids, where the multidomain protein can participate in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the presence of functional ACC2, tolerance is enhanced by a second locus that maps to chromosome 5 and heightened by additional genetic modifiers present in the most tolerant accessions. Notably, some of the most sensitive accessions contain nonsense mutations in ACC2, including the “Nossen” line used to generate several of the mutants studied here. Functional ACC2 protein is therefore not required for survival in natural environments, where heteromeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase encoded in part by the chloroplast genome can function instead. This work highlights an interesting example of a tandem gene duplication in Arabidopsis, helps to explain the range of embryo phenotypes found in Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in essential chloroplast functions, addresses the nature of essential proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome, and underscores the value of using natural variation to study the relationship between chloroplast translation, plant metabolism, protein import, and plant development.', 'acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase', 'centimorgan', 'quantitative reverse transcription-PCR', 'Landsberg erecta']
