['\n        Following polyploidy, duplicate genes are often deleted, and if they are not, then duplicate regulatory regions are sometimes lost. By what mechanism is this loss and what is the chance that such a loss removes function? To explore these questions, we followed individual Arabidopsis thaliana–A. thaliana conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) into the Brassica ancestor, through a paleohexaploidy and into Brassica rapa. Thus, a single Brassicaceae CNS has six potential orthologous positions in B. rapa; a single Arabidopsis CNS has three potential homeologous positions. We reasoned that a CNS, if present on a singlet Brassica gene, would be unlikely to lose function compared with a more redundant CNS, and this is the case. Redundant CNSs go nondetectable often. Using this logic, each mechanism of CNS loss was assigned a metric of functionality. By definition, proved deletions do not function as sequence. Our results indicated that CNSs that go nondetectable by base substitution or large insertion are almost certainly still functional (redundancy does not matter much to their detectability frequency), whereas those lost by inferred deletion or indels are approximately 75% likely to be nonfunctional. Overall, an average nondetectable, once-redundant CNS more than 30 bp in length has a 72% chance of being nonfunctional, and that makes sense because 97% of them sort to a molecular mechanism with “deletion” in its description, but base substitutions do cause loss. Similarly, proved-functional G-boxes go undetectable by deletion 82% of the time. Fractionation mutagenesis is a procedure that uses polyploidy as a mutagenic agent to genetically alter RNA expression profiles, and then to construct testable hypotheses as to the function of the lost regulatory site.

We show fractionation mutagenesis to be a “deletion machine” in the Brassica lineage.', 'A perplexing and long-standing problem in classical genetics is to know when a recessive mutant specifies a complete knockout of function. Even the sequence of mutants with recessive phenotypes compared with the wild type progenitor may not answer the question of functionality. If the mutation happened during evolution, inferred from comparisons of mutant with a more ancestral outgroup, it is even more difficult to predict functionality. Because of the history of paleopolyploidy in all plant lineages (Van de Peer 2011), updated at (http://synteny.cnr.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Sequenced_plant_genomes, last accessed March 23, 2013), and the consequent potential for functional redundancy, duplicate genes, or regulatory site sequences mutate into nondetectability. This postpolyploidy gene loss, called fractionation, is widespread and frequent. It is important to know whether such “loss” results in loss of function. One way to show that a loss of sequence detectability is a loss-of-function is to show that the loss is by deletion of sequence, because a deleted sequence cannot function.', 'When a genome doubles or triples, as with paleotetraploids or hexaploids, each chromosome with each gene is initially duplicated. What follows is a process of chromosomal evolution called “diploidization,” during which the polyploid becomes rearranged and altered to act as a meiotic diploid (Wolfe 2001). The newly diploidized polyploid tends to lose one or the other of its duplicate genes (fractionation), usually much of the time, as expected in theory (Lynch and Force 2000) and realized in practice (Sankoff et al. 2010). The fractionation mechanism is a sort of intrachromosomal recombination inferred from short repeats flanking progenitor-deleted sequences (Petrov et al. 1996; Devos et al. 2002), and is known for postpaleotetraploid maize (Woodhouse et al. 2010) and postpaleohexaploid Brassica rapa (Br) (Tang et al. 2012). Even if a gene pair survives polyploidy, perhaps because of subfunctionalization (Lynch and Force 2000) or tendency to maintain product dosage balance (Freeling 2009), that does not mean that all parts of the gene will remain duplicated. This study follows individual conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) known to exist around many Arabidopsis genes as they now exist in Br, a hexaploid. Figure 1 follows one ancestral Brassicaceae gene as it gets duplicated during the alpha paleotetraploidy, and then follows as each alpha homeolog splits into the lineage that will be Arabidopsis (At) or Br, and then through the Brassica lineage, on through the paleohexaploidy, and finally follows the genes into the six potential chromosomal positions on the three Br subgenomes. Sometimes a Br gene is fractionated and takes all of its At-orthologous CNSs with it, but sometimes the duplicate transcriptional unit and its cis sequences persist. In such cases, sometimes the At CNS being followed goes undetectable but the gene remains and is transcriptionally active. This has been shown previously in grasses (Schnable et al. 2011). The red arrow on figure 1 denotes such a CNS loss. The small squares decorating the gene models of figure 1 are CNSs.\nFig. 1.—The gene tree of a pre-alpha tetraploidy Brassicaceae gene with an protein-coding sequence (black arrow) and five CNSs (boxes on the model line) as it duplicates at the alpha and, in the Brassica lineage, undergoes an additional paleohexaploidy before it was sequenced in Brassica rapa (Br). The modal Ks values, for each of these three events are shown, as downloaded from the SynMap application in the CoGe toolbox. The red CNS exemplifies the sort of CNS we follow. It is detected as a conserved sequence between the two homeologous genomes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana, At), but is fractionated (red arrow) from one of the Br homeologs in this doublet. The gray lineage is of the “out-paralog” Brassica lineage, in this case represented in Br as a singleton gene. Note that a CNS was lost just 5′ of coding sequence, and is not present in the out-paralog lineage. Even though this CNS did exist in the test lineage, we did not test for it because we began with homeologous At–At CNSs.', 'The gene tree of a pre-alpha tetraploidy Brassicaceae gene with an protein-coding sequence (black arrow) and five CNSs (boxes on the model line) as it duplicates at the alpha and, in the Brassica lineage, undergoes an additional paleohexaploidy before it was sequenced in Brassica rapa (Br).

This mechanism is important because several CNSs have been shown to function as cis-acting regulators and are enriched in known DNA-binding motifs (Freeling and Subramaniam 2009; Raatz et al. 2011), they are associated with DNaseI open chromatin (Zhang et al. 2012) and with the suppression of gene expression (Spangler et al. 2011). Thus, CNS loss of detectability could predict loss of a specific regulatory function, but only in the case that the CNS loss marks loss of CNS function.', 'Crucifer CNSs in Arabidopsis have a history. Previous work (Thomas et al. 2007) found that 14,944 CNSs (alpha-CNSs, αCNSs, At–At CNSs) retained following the most recent tetraploidy in the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis, At) lineage. Genes retained as pairs following this tetraploidy, called homeologs (or homoeologs, Ohnologs, syntenic paralogs), have diverged a modal 0.76 in synonymous base substitution rate (Ks), and this was shown to be an adequate evolutionary divergence proxy to ensure that associated CNSs avoided purifying selection because CNSs on average, functioned. When divergence times become too great (>0.9 modal Ks), detection of CNSs becomes difficult, and when there is too little divergence, or when the detection algorithm settings are set without regard to noise levels (Kaplinsky et al. 2002; Thomas et al. 2007; Lyons and Freeling 2008), CNSs no longer indicate putative conserved function.', 'We know enough about the genome of Br to make some predictions. The three ancestral genomes of the new Br hexaploid do not remain intact for long. Fractionation soon removed most of the redundant duplicated genes (Wang et al. 2011) and is predicted to have removed some duplicate CNSs as well. Thus, each CNS in Br is retained as a singlet, a doublet, or a triplet depending on whether its gene is retained, and if its gene is retained, depending on whether the CNS itself remains detectable. Some go undetectable, as with the CNS position at the tip of the red arrow of figure 1. The background “neutral” base substitution rate between Arabidopsis and Br orthologs (0.38, legend fig. 1) will tend, in theory, to substitute nucleotides in CNSs that contribute little or nothing to CNS function. The αCNSs of Arabidopsis contain sequences that come with varying blastn E values and lengths down to 15 bp. As plant CNSs contain DNA-binding motifs (Freeling and Subramaniam 2009) as they do in mammals (Pennacchio et al. 2007; von Rohr et al. 2007), motifs known to be short and inexact (7–12 bp with alternatives), some of the At αCNSs should not be detected in Br even though they might contain functional motifs because the motifs are shorter than the minimal length of detectable CNSs. In short, if base substitution were the prevailing mechanism of going nondetectable, then CNSs could drift into nondetectability and still conserve typical, functional DNA-binding motifs. However, no matter what the mechanism of nondetectability, selection for functional loss should be greater for a CNS on a singleton gene, the CNS being more unique-sequence, as compared with CNS on each of a doublet or triplet Br gene, the more redundant situation. This inference is the basis of our essential strategy; see the second footnote of table 1 where our strategy is applied to real data.\nTable 1Gene Redundancy Was Used to Infer Whether an Undetectable At CNS Is Undetectable in Br Because It Has Been Mutated into Nonfunction and Categorization by “Predominant Cause” Was Done ComputationallyPredominant Cause of At–At CNS Loss in Br Determined by ComputationB/ATotal No. of Undetectable 5′ + 3′ CNSs > 30 Basesa/Total (%)Functionality MetricbA = N (%) for CNSs in Singlet Br Genes (Control)B = N (%) for CNSs in Doublet or Triplet Br GenesA + B1 = functional———1.

As much is known about particular G-boxes within CNSs (Freeling et al. 2007), based on previous work on this motif and transcription factors that bind some G-boxes, we study how G-boxes become nondetectable as well. Our categories of loss: 1) base substitutions (the pseudogene pathway), 2) proved deletions (removal of one or both flanking markers as well as the CNS), 3) computationally inferred deletions, 4) indels, or 5) large insertions. Indels have been recently identified as a significant mutational endpoint in plants (Hollister et al. 2010).', 'Understanding how plant CNSs go undetectable is important for several reasons. In animals, explanations have been proposed for how undetectable enhancer sequences sometimes retain function, including “binding site turnover” (Hancock et al. 1999; Ludwig et al. 2000; Dermitzakis and Clark 2002) and “dormant TF-binding sites” (Junion et al. 2012). These mechanisms require nonfunctional sequences drifting along the pseudogene pathway before they mutate back to function. Such mechanisms become less likely as nonfunctional DNA is deleted more quickly in plants. Additionally, knowing the mechanism of CNS fractionation is particularly important in light of a genetic-type method we have proposed called “fractionation mutagenesis” (Freeling et al. 2012). This method quantifies the RNA levels of duplicate genes in a polyploid and also compares each homeolog’s CNS-loss pattern. A mutant expression pattern is then associated with a lost CNS or a cluster of CNSs, and these previously mysterious sequences acquire a testable hypothesis as to ancestral function. We will show that this method of fractionation mutagenesis comprises a natural “deletion machine” 84% of the time in the posthexaploidy Brassica lineage and deletion mutations are certainly loss-of-function.', 'Our At–At CNSs reflect one definition of a CNS: a syntenic noncoding conservation detected by blastn with significance at or better than a 15/15 exact match, and between genomes or subgenomes diverged to a modal Ks of 0.9–0.5 (Freeling and Subramaniam 2009). The CNS data set produced has the advantages of having been the object of some study, and because this data set depends on local alignments generating an even-handed sampling of conserved noncoding regions no matter how far they may exist from any conserved coding sequence. It is certainly more sensitive to anchor on a coding part of the gene and extend alignments, but this sensitivity only applies close to the anchor. For example, multiple global alignments anchored on the start of transcription and moving up to 1 kb 5′ have provided an excellent CNS data set, and they do overlap with ours (Baxter et al. 2012), but this data set goes deficient in those CNSs moving from 500 bp to 15 kb away from the nearest exon; transposon insertions disrupt global alignments. No one method of obtaining CNSs is best. Fortunately, complete coverage is not important for us to see how Arabidopsis CNSs are lost in the posthexaploidy Br lineage (fig. 1), so we use homeologous Arabidopsis CNSs from our At–At v2 data set (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) described later.', 'In 2006, there were no sequenced Brassicaceae genomes within the window of Ks 0.5–0.9. However, the two alpha A. thaliana subgenomes descended from its most recent paleotetraploidy were nicely diverged for CNS discovery, so the TAIR4 version of the Arabidopsis genome was compared with itself (Thomas et al. 2007). Of the original 14,944 individual At–At CNS sequences of version 1, 3,635 CNSs were removed: 82 were found to be out of synteny, 22 erroneous CNS calls, 169 CNSs were reassigned to neighboring genes, 1,831 CNSs were invalidated due to wrong direction, and 1,531 CNSs were found to overlap coding DNA sequences (CDSs) or RNA genes, called as annotation of plant genomes became more complete. Version 2 CNSs, identified in relation to TAIR8 annotations, are syntenous in relation to other homeologous features. Column A of supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, is a notation for each of these version 2 CNSs that includes the At gene name to which each sorts; the actual sequence of this sequence is displayed later in the row. Our CNS calls may be proofed easily with the GEvo links of supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online. GEvo is the sequence comparison tool in the CoGe toolbox (http://genomevolution.org, last accessed March 23, 2013) of comparative genomics applications (Lyons and Freeling 2008). GEvo provides a graphical comparison of multiple genomic regions indicating high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) for a variety of sequence similarity testing algorithms (selected under the “Algorithm” tab of GEvo), between the defined genomic regions. GEvo was used extensively during our version 1 to version 2 update. The 11,302 version 2 At–At CNSs have been “burnt” onto a TAIR8 genome on the model line—this genome is identified as id 39598 in CoGe. These CNSs can be visualized within GEvo by selecting “Yes” for “Show pre-annotated CNSs” under the “Results Visualization Options” tab in GEvo. Using GEvo, our precalled CNS positions can be readily compared through HSPs generated by blastn (default blastn settings with a spike of 15 nucleotides). Column B of supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, is easy to parse for CNS length; we focus only on those 2,509 longer CNSs for our focal experiment in which we define a functionality metric for each category of αCNS loss (table 1). However, all version 2 CNSs are used for other experiments and all motif experiments.', 'For each of the 6,330 At genes with a retained At α-homeolog (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online), we used the synteny screening blocks technique (Tang et al. 2011) to identify all possible orthologous regions in the Br Chiifu (Chinese cabbage) genome. Given the recent hexaploidy in the Br lineage (fig. 1), we expected to find up to three orthologous copies for each At gene. Of the 6,330 At genes used for version 2 CNS discovery, we (Tang et al. 2012) identified at least one Br ortholog for 6,245 of them, with 2,391 At genes having a single detectable orthologous copy in Br (singlets), 1,723 At genes with two orthologous copies in Br (doublets), and 654 At genes with three orthologous copies in Br (triplets).', 'In the absence of CNS fractionation, and assuming that our CNSs were sorted to their correct gene, we expected to find the CNS whenever we found the gene in Br. Based on At–Br orthologies, we expected to find 9,179 CNSs within expected orthologous positions, 3,882 as singlets, 3,678 as doublets, and 1,619 as triplets. We attempted to detect each of these 9,179 αCNSs within each expected orthologous Br region. Nucleotide sequence of the gene space (expanded genomic region around and including coding regions and spanning from farthest upstream to downstream CNS) of each At gene containing one or more of these 9,179 CNSs was masked for very repeated sequences (50× copies across entire At genome). The corresponding gene space of each detected orthologous region (singlet, doublet, or triplet ortholog) in Br was also repeat masked. Each At and Br orthologous genespace pair was compared using the same blast settings used for At–At CNS discovery (Thomas et al. 2007). Every blast HSP hit to the Br orthologous genespace was then screened for synteny, using a perl script, to filter out probable noise, whereas simple sequences were filtered out using the DUST filter option of BLAST.', 'αCNSs that do not show a hit using the above blastn settings are valuable data. In the following section, we describe analysis of such sequences using a global alignment algorithm to determine the nature of evolutionary modifications that may have contributed to the lack of detectability of these CNSs. The general idea is this: The CNSs “lost” in a singlet are assumed to still function, but to have drifted in functionless sequence, or to have suffered “binding site turnover” (Moses et al. 2006). Our Discussion section argues that this assumption is not the whole story, but we did make this assumption. Any frequency of nondetectability above the baseline of loss in singletons was interpreted as being caused by actual functional loss either by base substitution, deletion, small indels, or a large insertion.', 'Earlier, we described the use of our previously published CNS discovery blastn settings to measure detectability of αCNSs within expected orthologous gene spaces within each of the three Br subgenomes. Each αCNS that was not detected in the expected orthologous region of Br using our standard settings was retested to determine the predominant mechanisms that could potentially contribute to the lack of detectability. We started by identifying and extracting the nucleotide sequence for the expected orthologous regions for each αCNS that was not detectable within Br. As in the case of the blastn analysis used for measuring CNS detectability, we used the Br orthologous gene spaces (coding region + 40 kb on both sides of coding region) as the subject sequence. The query sequences were the coding regions of the At gene to which the αCNS was assigned in version 2 (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) to which was added the nucleotide sequence extending out to and including the farthest upstream and downstream CNS. In supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online, the GEvo link points to a graphic where this At gene space is highlighted yellow; to see this requires selecting “see genespace” in the GEvo options panel.', 'Each pair of At and Br gene spaces were compared using blastz with default settings. The position of each αCNS was studied for overlap with any blastz HSP (high scoring segment pair) between the At and Br genespaces. Those CNSs that overlapped with blastz HSPs were assigned the location of the HSP (start and stop positions) as its expected location in Br. CNSs that did not overlap a blastz HSP, but were found flanked by blastz HSPs, were assigned an expected position between the flanking HSPs. In cases where flanking HSPs were not present, depending on the position of the CNS relative to the gene, the expected location was defined from either the start of the orthologous genespace to the start position of the gene, or the stop position of the Br gene to the end of the Br genespace (Tang et al. 2012). An example of this procedure follows. Supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online (http://genomevolution.org/r/4dc3, last accessed March 23, 2013) shows an annotated view of the same GEvo panel described earlier (fig. 3), but now displays blastz HSPs between the At gene and its Br orthologs. In this figure, αCNS 315; 2;CNS_s680 (pink highlight in fig. 3) overlaps with a blastz HSP in Br II and Br III but falls between 2 flanking HSPs in Br I. The search sequences used for studying the mechanisms acting on this CNS in Br II and Br III are the blastz HSPs labeled Br II and Br III (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). The orthologous region in Br I falls between these two blastz HSPs, indicated in pink highlight in supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online.', 'There are several possible reasons for a CNSs to go undetectable: deletions of an entire chromosomal segment resulting in the removal of one or more CNSs, or relatively smaller scale changes including insertions, smaller deletions, a combination of both (indels) and base substitutions making individual CNSs undetectable. For smaller CNSs, even one base substitution would either destroy the minimum exact match blast wordsize or drop the CNS below the E value cutoff, that equal to a 15/15 exact match. We wrote a simple perl script to use a global alignment algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch 1970) with cost-free ends (BLOSUM 62) to align the nucleotide sequences of each αCNS without a detectable ortholog in Br with the expected orthologous regions within Br; these regions were found as described previously.', 'Using the genomic positions for the expected location of each CNS in Br to inform our search, we generated an alignment between each CNS sequence and the nucleotide sequence (repeat masked) corresponding to the expected location in Br. The Br and At sequences were aligned using a global alignment algorithm (not a blast family algorithm) with no end gap penalties (Needleman and Wunsch 1970). We did this because the CNS sequence length is much shorter than the Br subject sequence. A score value was generated for each alignment and a P value statistic was used to measure quality of alignment. As control for the alignment for each αCNS, we used a perl script to generate 10,000 “scrambled” random sequences, each representing a “random” permutation of the nucleotides that make up each CNS. The alignment score for each CNS was compared with those of the 10,000 random sequences to generate the P value of significance. We define any alignment with P value less than or equal to 0.05 as being “above noise.” Each high-quality, optimal alignment generated by the global-npe algorithm was analyzed using perl scripts for deletions, base substitutions, insertions, and exact matches at each position. Alignments with gaps only on the Br sequence were classified (using a perl script) as deletions, those with gaps only on the At sequence were classified as insertions and when gaps occurred on both Br and At sequences, such alignments were classified as indels. We then used these “gaps” data to infer the predominant mechanism contributing to lack of detectability of At–At α-CNSs in Br.', 'As our Br sequence is from Chiifu, a Chinese cabbage variety, it is important to know that our RNA expression data are from this same genotype. RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) data for genes expressed in seedling stem, leaves, and roots has been analyzed and presented in supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online, (Cheng et al. 2012) as a control experiment for potential gene death.', 'Using version 1 of the At αCNS list, previous work (Freeling et al. 2007) identified a few known transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS), as regular expression motifs, that were significantly enriched in αCNS sequence as compared with noncoding, nonconserved sequence. While the G-box, a “strictly conserved” palindromic hexamer, was by far the most significantly enriched, other “strictly conserved” motifs were significantly enriched over 2-fold as well. By “strictly conserved,” we mean that at least 5 nucleotides within the consensus sequence for the motif must be conserved in the same order; e.g., For the G-box, the consensus motif is CACGTG, the core of the consensus motif “ACGTG” should be conserved to be considered “strictly conserved.” Because this work begins with a revised CNS list, version 2, and because we wanted to refine how we controlled for nonfunctional motifs (e.g., we did not mask transposons in our previous work), we updated our enriched motif list (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). We did not use all of the often overlapping motifs available, and in the literature, but concentrated only on 12 motifs picked that were, like the G-box, more strictly conserved and enriched by more than 2× in CNSs: CACGTG (the G-Box), 5′ACGTGGC (in the ACGT category), GCCGCC (jasmonic acid box), 5′AAACCCTA, and 5′CCGTCC (Freeling et al. 2007) to which we added [CT]ACGTGGC, CACGTGGC, ACGTGGCA, ACGTGTC, AAACCCTAA, TGTCTC, CCACGTGG. Several of these motifs can be seen (italicized) to be similar. This strictly conserved criterion was used, so that we could more easily infer whether they were intact following mutation to nondetectability. Specific references for each motif sequence are in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online, and in a beta-test application in CoGe: MotifView (http://genomevolution.org/CoGe/MotifView.pl, last accessed March 23, 2013). Noncoding, nonconserved, and nontransposon regions from within the same gene space as each αCNS were used as the control for each of these motif enrichment studies.', 'Oh et al. (2009) used ChIP-chip (chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray sequence recognition methods) data to infer that 748 Arabidopsis genomic-binding sites were occupied by basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor PIL5 and 166 nearby genes were upregulated directly by PIL5. As PIL5 has been shown to bind CACGTG, each G-box within a PIL5 “peak” represents a strong argument for a functional G-Box. We compared these PIL5 sites for overlap with our αCNSs. These 32 G-boxes were assumed to be particularly likely to be functional. Five of these CNSs did not have an ortholog in Br; understanding these is outside of our topic. The remaining 27 were studied at all orthologous positions in Br.', 'The relatively low number of αCNS-PIL5 peak overlaps was expected. αCNSs (not being orthologous CNSs) can only include those cis-acting sites that were retained after the most recent tetraploidy in the Arabidopsis lineage. Further, our unanchored blastn pairwise CNS discovery tool, while necessary to find CNSs that are far from coding sequence syntenic anchors, is known to miss many if not most of the cis-acting sites that are close to the transcription unit (Thomas et al. 2007).', 'The updated version 2 αCNSs list (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) now contains 11,448 sequences or 5,724 α pairs (α pairs are homeologous pairs derived from the most recent whole genome duplication event in the lineage of A. thaliana). These αCNSs were used to search for retention within Br at orthologous loci. As a control for our CNSs discovered through manual comparison of homeologous regions in At (v2), we ran our automated CNS Discovery Pipeline v3.0 (https://github.com/gturco/find_cns/tree/master/pipeline, last accessed March 23, 2013) over our homeologous gene pairs to generate an automated At–At αCNS data set (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). There is 80% concordance between the automated and manually generated CNS data sets; the v2 data set was used in this study. The αCNSs, (both v2 and the pipeline 3.0, for comparison) have been added to the gene models of TAIR8 in CoGe as genome data set ID = 39598 (http://genomevolution.org/r/4iaq, last accessed March 23, 2013). Our supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online, includes links to GEvo in CoGe using these customized genespace models, thus facilitating reproduction and proofing of our results.

Genome dominance and purifying selection explain this phenomenon, using the exact same argument that was proven valid in maize. In terms of CNS detectability, we expect the dominant subgenome (III) to carry most of the genes that are singlets, and subgenomes I and II to have endured the most gene and CNS loss.', 'For each of the 6,330 At genes with a retained At α-homeolog, each used for CNS discovery, we used our synteny screening blocks technique (Tang et al. 2012) to identify all possible orthologous regions in the Br genome. Given that the recent hexaploidy in Br occurred following divergence from the Arabidopsis lineage (fig. 1), we expected to find up to three orthologous copies for each At gene.

We expected to find, in the absence of mutation, an αCNS whenever its gene was present. So, each gene in a doublet or triplet would have an expected CNS. Based on At–Br orthologies, we expected to find 9,179 CNSs within the expected orthologous positions, 3,882 as singlets, 3,678 as doublets and 1,619 as triplets. Our detectability results are in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online. Many mutations to nondetectability occurred.', 'The version 2 CNS collection includes CNSs as short as 15 bp and as long as 283, and each has an E value more significant than that of a 15/15 exact nucleotide match. Even one base substitution would render some of these sequences undetectable using our blastn settings, so we expected that detectability would increase with length, and it did. αCNS length versus detectability was plotted for all version 2 αCNSs. Figure 4A shows these data for Br ortholog singlets, doublets, and triplets. In general, detectability is greater in singlets then doublets than triplets, as expected from our previous results and our general understanding of purifying selection and CNS redundancy. For singlets, detectability increases from 40% for 15–19 bp to 96% for more than 76 bp, with the 31–40 bp bin being 85% detectable. For the bin 51–75 bp, detectability was 62%, 72%, and 91% for triplets, doublets, and singlets, respectively. We chose those 2,509 αCNSs that are more than 30 bp in length to analyze further as to the molecular mechanism of their loss of detectability.\nFig. 4.—(A) CNS length versus detectability.

Figure 4B: Each αCNS is localized to one of the nine “categories” of Br genome: singlet subgenome I, singlet II, singlet III, doublet I, doublet II, doublet III, triplet I, triplet II, and triplet III. Figure 4B includes numbers of genes in each category, and probabilities that particularly interesting differences are significantly different. Detectability for CNSs on singlet genes is generally greater than that for doublet or triplet; that is expected because it should be more difficult to remove a singlet CNS without removing function. Detectability of CNSs on singlet genes of subgenome III is approximately 100%, and is significantly more than detectability of singlets on subgenomes II and I. There is certainly subgenome bias in the detectability of CNSs. This interesting result is not easy to explain, is probably important, and will be discussed.', 'Having located the stretch of chromosome in Br where the missing CNS could be, we devised a global alignment algorithm, global-npe, to identify the predominant mechanism of removal of CNSs. Table 1, column 1 lists these predominant mutational causes for the failure to detect a CNS. For each mechanism, impact on detectability within singlet genes was used as a control, and recorded as data in column A of table 1. We then sorted the 498 redundant (doublets and triplets), undetectable CNSs into mutational mechanism categories, and recorded these data in column B. B/A is the functionality metric, with a fully functional CNS category scoring 1, by definition. B/A ranged from 5.3 (nonfunctional deletions) to 1 (fully functional). The functionality metric is useful. As deleted DNA cannot be functional, we now know that computed deletions have a 64% chance of being nonfunctional. Base substitutions, however, have a 91% chance of still being functional (but there are not many CNSs that have gone undetectable for this reason). Insertions may destroy detectability, while function is almost always maintained. Overall, the average nondetectable, once-redundant CNS has a 72% chance of being nonfunctional, and that makes sense because 97% of them sort to a molecular mechanism with “deletion” in its description. Deletion is the predominant mutational mechanism for the lack of detectability of αCNSs in Br, but other mechanisms operate as well.', 'Although our functionality metric differences imply that genes with undetectable CNSs generally function, it is more rigorous to test directly to see if the loss of CNSs is somehow correlated with the loss of gene function. Cheng et al. (2012) published RPKM values in leaves, stems, and roots of seedling Br Chiifu; our subgenomes I, II, and III are their subgenomes MF1, MF2, and LF. Using two different cutoffs for potential gene death, there was no correlation between loss of CNSs and potential gene death (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). There was a slight tendency for subgenome I to have more dead genes than other subgenomes, and, as expected, the more stringent cutoff found fewer (∼7%) potentially dead genes as compared more potentially dead genes (∼17%) for the permissive threshold. Conclusions from this control experiment: CNS nondetectability or even total CNS loss is not correlated with gene death, so there is no need to modify the predictions of the functionality metric of table 1. Note that three organs in one environment do not monitor all of the possible expression endpoints, so the frequencies of genes that are actually dead are definitely below these potential death values (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online).', 'TFBS motifs contained within Arabidopsis αCNSs, and enriched more than 2-fold within CNSs, were studied without regard to whether their CNSs were detectable in Br. They were detected as an exact match in the expected genespace region. Were any such motif in Arabidopsis lacking function in the Brassica lineage, base substitution alone (At–Br Ks = 0.38) would likely lead to nondetectability: a 5mer would become undetectable 91% of the time, and a 6mer, like the G box, would go undetectable 95% of the time if base substitution were the only mutational mechanism operating (which is certainly not the case). Supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online, updates αCNS enrichment data from 2007 (Freeling et al. 2007)—using version 2 CNSs. For our TFBS detectability and enrichment studies, we included all 11,448 At αCNSs, not just those more than 30-bp long. We studied 12 motifs, and 8 of them contained the 5′ACGTG core (colored red in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online); this core is part of the G-box. Of these, each motif was counted as complement plus reverse-complement. The most enriched motif was the G-box (CACGTG palindrome) at 12.9-fold. 12.9 times more G-boxes are in αCNSs than in nontransposon, noncoding, non-CNS control space, normalized by position relative to the gene. The six base pair G-box derivatives plus core were all significantly enriched, but at values as low as 6-fold. The four not-G-box motifs were significantly enriched at between 2.4- and 8.1-fold. We found a poor correlation between motif enrichment and detectability in Br for these 12 motifs, although the G-box itself—most enriched—was third highest in detectability at 63%. Higher than the G-box in detectability was the 5′CCGTCC “meristem” box at 65%, with an enrichment of 8.1-fold. The jasmonic acid box, 5′GCCGCC, enriched to a paltry 2.4-fold, was relatively highly detectable at 50%, and highly enriched G-box-core 8-mer derivative 5′CACGTGGC was detectable in Br only 26% of the time. Detectability is certainly giving us clues as to what sequence is essential for any generalized function, and what sequences may be superfluous, as will be discussed. For example, the 5′ACGTG G-box core was the most detectable motif of all, at 67.5%. In the absence of additional information, it seems obvious that some motifs may function in Br even though mutated while others have more absolute requirements for continuing function. The G-box itself is a CNS-enriched motif that seems to have a requirement for near-perfect sequence conservation to preserve function, and is especially intolerant to changes in the 5′ACGTG core. Therefore, the G box is a known motif that should be useful to study to independently determine the mutational mechanism that causes nondetectability.', 'As we already provided evidence that 75% lost CNSs were deleted and thus, were mutated to no function, our premise is that G-boxes are primarily lost by deletion. Given our ability to pull-out and analyze expected orthologous regions within Br for comparison with the corresponding conserved noncoding space in Arabidopsis, we looked at all CNS-enclosed G-boxes and, more importantly, a subset of these that were experimentally shown to function in light regulation. PIL5 is an Arabidopsis transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix type that is known to bind sequence containing a G-box. Oh et al. (2009) used microarray data and ChIP-chip (fragments from chromatin immunoprecipitation were localized by hybridization on microarrays) data to infer that, of the 748 Arabidopsis genomic binding sites occupied by PIL5, 166 genes were upregulated in light directly by PIL5. Each PIL5 site represents a strong argument for a functional G-Box. We compared these PIL5 sites for overlap with our αCNS data set and identified 27 αCNSs containing a PIL5-informed G-Box. Each CNS was traced in all expected orthologous positions in Br. For each undetectable G-Box, we used our global-npe alignment to identify the predominant evolutionary mechanism that mutated the motif to undetectability in the Br lineage. Again, G-boxes were followed for detectability independent of whether the CNS expected to carry them was detected in Br. Figure 5 gives these results for all αCNS G-boxes and for the 27 G-boxes comprising the “most likely to function” subset, side-by-side. Our overall result: deletions—not point mutations, indels or insertions—removed the detectability of the majority of G-boxes: 73% for CNS-contained motifs and 82% for PIL5-informed G-boxes. Base substitutions account for a smaller but significant portion, approximately 15%, of G-box mutations to nondetectability.\nFig. 5.—Predominant mechanism causing lack of detection of the G-Box (CACGTG) within αCNSs within the expected orthologous segments of Brassica rapa. Data for G-Boxes detected using a regular expression are labeled MF-G-Boxes; data for PIL-5 defined G-Boxes detected within αCNSs are labeled as PIL5-G-Box. Pil5-G-boxes are a subset.', 'Predominant mechanism causing lack of detection of the G-Box (CACGTG) within αCNSs within the expected orthologous segments of Brassica rapa.

Pil5-G-boxes are a subset.', 'Table 1 summarizes the complete CNS detectability data of supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online. Based on the length versus detectability data of Figure 4A, we demanded that CNSs be more than 30-bp long for our focal analysis of table 1. We reasoned that CNSs localized to genes that were fractionated down to one (singlets) would loss their genes rarely; from table 1, this “loss” frequency was 10%, and this became our least-redundant control pool. (This frequency of 10% is not negligible and is discussed in the next section.) Those CNSs that existed near doublet and triplet genes are expected to be relatively more redundant and more liable to loss-of-function mutation, so these CNSs became our experimental pool. We expected that more-redundant CNSs should go undetectable by whatever mutational mechanisms operated in the Br lineage to a greater frequency than they go undetectable in the singlet controls. This was indeed the case (fig. 4A and B; supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). Overall, an At αCNS more than 30-bp long, either 5′ or 3′ of its gene, mutates to undetectability in Br 33% of the time (table 1, last row, column B). The functionality metric for those CNSs that go undetectable by proved chromosomal deletions was 5.3, becoming our maximum not functional value; the CNS must be nonfunctional because the original DNA is not there. A functionality metric of 1 indicates complete functionality because redundancy makes no difference; nondetectability by large insertion had a negligible effect on functionality. The functionality matrix for those CNSs going undetectable because of base substitutions was 1.8, meaning that only 34% of CNSs in this category lost function, 66% of them still functioned even though they were undetectable. However, only 1% (16/1,543) more-redundant CNSs (column B) CNSs went undetectable for this reason. Considering all 498 cases where a more-redundant CNS went undetectable in the Br lineage (table 1, last row), 72% of these went nonfunctional, as expected because they were largely placed in categories characterized by the word “deletion.”', 'There was no correlation between CNS loss and potential gene death (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Different branches on the plant phylogenetic tree have differed greatly in transposon blooms and polyploidies. Although there is no experimental evidence, it is possible that the rate of deletion and/or the size of the average deletion differs greatly among plant lineage, so extrapolating from our “mostly deletions” conclusion in Brassica to other plant lineages is not warranted. Interestingly, researchers in the detectability of ultra-CNSs in vertebrates noticed that post-paleotetraploid teleost fish lost CNS detectability much faster than sister vertebrate lineages not undergoing polyploidy (Lee et al. 2011). Again, an “induction” relationship is possible, but not proved.', 'The deletion mechanism we envision is the intrachromosomal recombination mechanism discovered for transposons in Drosophila (Petrov et al. 1996), described for transposons and genes, respectively, in maize (Devos et al. 2002; Woodhouse et al. 2010), evidenced in Br as rare exons carrying deletions (Tang et al. 2012), in rice (Tian et al. 2009) and inferred here to be the prevailing mutation mechanism in Br. The importance of short direct repeats flanking deleted DNA was first shown as a RecA-responsive process in bacteria (Albertini et al. 1982). Not all deletions need to be caused by the same mechanism. Some deletions may be mediated by flanking transposons and/or mis-repair of gaps caused in the movement process (Wicker et al. 2010). Similarly, strand slippage in the replication fork could generate short intrachromoaomal recombination deletions (Petrov 2002). Whatever the mechanism, the fact that we often see kilobase stretches of Br (and in maize: Woodhouse et al. 2010) removed when a gene and all of its CNS are fractionated does not mean that deletions in plants are long. It seems obvious that, once an initial deletion renders the gene functionless, then some combination of [rate of deletion] and/or [length of deletion] will incrementally remove the entire cis-acting unit.', 'There has been enough work in animal rates and lengths of deletion to permit a gross comparison of our Brassica lineage deletion process and that operating in any animal studied. There are no examples of an ordinary gene being lost in the human lineage by deletion; all are still present in situ as pseudogenes (Schrider et al. 2009); the human–chimpanzee is about as diverged as are the Br subgenomes! When genes were lost from the pheromone network in old word apes, the genes remain as obvious pseudogenes (Liman and Innan 2003); they were not deleted. Petrov (2002), in a theoretical essay on how the C-value paradox is best solved by a balance of deletion and insertion, reviewed the data of others on average rate of deletion per bp substitution and the average size of these deletions. He reviewed data in Drosophila, C. elegans, crickets, primates + rodents, and grasshoppers. Average rates of deletions per base pair substitution ranged from a low of 5% in the mammals to a high of 8.7% in Drosophila. The average size of a deletion was more variable, from a low of 1.6 bp in grasshoppers thru 3.2 base pairs for the mammals to a maximum of 48 bp for Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'For the purpose of illustration, imagine a 10-kb stretch of DNA that used to contain an entire gene and cis-acting elements. In the Brassica lineage, a Ks = 15% (the Br–Br Ks, fig. 1) is enough divergence time to remove the entire genespace—exons plus all CNSs—without a trace; this occurred routinely during gene fractionation after the paleohexaploidy (Wang et al. 2011). Using Petrov et al.’s (1996) maximum animal deletion rate/bp (0.13 for Drosophila) and Drosophila’s deletion length of 38 bp, This 10 kb of functionless DNA would suffer 0.15 × 0.13= 2% of its bps, or 200 deletion events, each averaging 35-bp long, giving 7 kb of deletion. Using the mammalian rate and length, and the earlier-mentioned crude arithmetic method, primates and rodents would delete only 240 bp of the 10 kb. The Brassica lineage uses a combination of deletion rate and length to more rapidly delete its functionless DNA than animals with tiny genomes and vast population sizes, and far more rapidly than do primates and rodents. The most obvious difference between plants and animals are the hundreds of millions of pollen shed per plant, each grain being a haploid gametophyte. Somehow, the plant’s biology accommodates the “genetic load” commensurate with its relatively strong pressure of purifying selection.', 'All of the CNSs used in this study were from homeologous gene pairs retained from the most recent tetraploidy in the Arabidopsis lineage (modal Ks 76%, fig. 1, called alpha). Thus, each of these CNSs is redundant or nearly so in Arabidopsis. When this gene is triplicated as part of the paleohexaploidy in the Br lineage, there are originally three copies of the progenitor gene and its associated CNSs. If all but one of these genes fractionates, one might guess that the remaining one gene, and each of its CNSs, would confer some nonredundant, unique function. However, 10% of the CNSs expected to be with these singletons are undetectable. In fact, the assessment of “nonredundant” is probably not the whole truth. For every singleton Br gene used in this study, there is a possible out-paralog (Koonin 2005)—the descendants of the Arabidopsis alpha pair—gene family in Br that can be a singlet, doublet, or triplet. This out-paralog lineage is included in figure 1 as grayed-out. In some cases, it may not matter which of these genes is active as long as a “correct” contingent of them are retained to specify optimal product levels. As a general test of this reasoning, we analyzed supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online, and asked, “do singleton genes in Br have more first cousin genes (decedents of this gene’s α-pair) with retained doublet and triplets?” In other words, did the genome compensate for the loss of an Arabidopsis gene by amplifying retention of the “out-paralog” swout-paralog gene, (Koonin 2005) such that we should really consider all six potential Br orthologs of the alpha pair when we are studying dosage relationships. The data (from supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online): When an At gene is retained as a singlet ortholog in Br, there is at least one detectable out-paralog 87% of the time. However, if the At is retained as a doublet, then at-least-one out-paralog retention drops to 75%, and if retained as a triplet, the out-paralog retention frequency drops further to 72%. Clearly, there is some overlap of function among the six immediate descendants of an alpha pair. Consider further: Before alpha in the Brassicales phylogenetic tree, the beta duplication generated another potential of six “out-paralogs” that we have not yet included in our conceivably dose-sensitive networks (fig. 1). For these reasons, we are careful to note that a “singleton” gene in Br is not “nonredundant,” but “less redundant”.', 'The sort of reasoning used above is complicated because there is an overall expectation that—for gene functions requiring a fixed stoichiometry of product level—many genes will be selected for maintaining the status quo of product balance (Birchler and Veitia 2010). However, there have been multiple polyploidies in the lineage of all plants (fig. 1) that certainly led to functional redundancy. Add to this complexity the fact that genes on over-fractionated subgenomes are expected to—on average—express to lower RNA levels than do genes on the less fractionated homeolog (Schnable et al. 2011). For Br, subgenome III is the dominant subgenome (Cheng et al. 2012).', 'Plant CNS function is supported by conservation itself (Lockton and Gaut 2005; Reineke et al. 2011), the association of CNS-richness with particular genes and motifs (Freeling and Subramaniam 2009), the positive association of CNSs with open chromatin (Zhang et al. 2012) and by expression association studies (Spangler et al. 2011). This study approaches the function question by comparing less-redundant CNS loss—those on singlet Br genes—with the loss of more-redundant CNSs, as they are expected to exit on doublet and triplet Br genes. Figure 4A shows the relationship between detectability and CNS length: with one exceptional data point, CNSs expected to be on singlet genes are more detectable than CNSs expected on doublets are more detectable than on triplets. This makes sense if purifying selection is strongest when there is only one copy, moderately strong when there are two copies and weak for triplets. For the bin carrying the shortest CNSs, detectability is 2.9-fold higher for a singlet than for a triplet. For the bin carrying the median-lengthed CNS (31–30 bp), a singlet is 1.8-fold more detectable as a singlet than as a triplet, with the doublet in the middle. This result implicates selection—and αCNS function—unless mutation rates are somehow correlated with the redundancy of cis-acting regulatory units motifs; that is not reasonable.', 'The results of figure 4B involving redundancy versus detectability are, in general, expected, but the differences in detectability of singlet CNSs depending on the subgenome (I vs. II vs. III) is disturbing. That subgenome III always has more detectable CNSs than do the other two subgenomes cannot be ignored. As with the data of figure 4A, purifying selection seems to act most strongly on CNSs that are less redundant. Removing a unique CNS from a gene could well remove an essential or selectable function. However, why should it matter on what subgenome the singlet αCNS is located? It does. Singlets on I, II, and III are detectable at 82%, 87%, and 96% with differences significant, P < 0.05. Although none of these differences is much smaller than 100%, there still must be an explanation. The most obvious is that subgenome III is less mutagenetic; it deletes at a lower rate than the other subgenomes for some structural reason. This “mutationist” hypothesis was very much in contention as an explanation of biased fractionation, where one subgenome’s genes gets deleted significantly more often than the other subgenome (Sankoff et al. 2010; Freeling et al. 2012). However, this mutationist alternative was considered carefully and disproved unequivocally in the case of the maize paleotetraploid (Schnable et al. 2011). It was shown that both subgenomes of maize suffer mutations—deletions via intrachromosomal recombination (Woodhouse et al. 2010)—at the same rate but that one subgenome expresses its genes to higher levels than the other on average, so pairs of genes tended to fractionate the homeolog that expresses least. These workers (Schnable et al. 2011) did not just demonstrate that genome dominance predicts biased fractionation; they actually tested the rate of deletion of functionless transposon and intron DNA between subgenomes and found the rates to be the same. For these reasons, the “selectionist, not mutationist” explanation was adopted for the maize lineage tetraploidy, and predicted to apply to the paleohexaploidy in the Brassica lineage as well. For Br: fractionation is biased with subgenome III being the least deleted (Wang et al. 2011), the mechanism of exon loss is deletion (Tang et al. 2012), and subgenome III dominates its RNA levels over subgenomes I and II (Cheng et al. 2012), just as is the case of maize. Perhaps singlets on subgenome III carry genes that are particularly and continuously important for growth and development, and singlets on the not-dominant subgenomes just do not matter quite as much.', 'Figure 5 graphs detectability in Br (as an exact motif sequence) of 1) G-boxes within all At αCNSs and 2) a subset of these G-boxes that are also experimentally validated (by ChIP-chip) PIL5 helix-loop-helix transcription factor binding sites. As expected from the CNS detectability results (table 1), G-boxes that lose exact sequence are almost always deleted, not lost by base substitution.', 'Supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online, presents our update of CNS enrichment values given our version 2 of the At αCNS list, and slightly updated methods. This table also presents detectability data for all motifs enriched significantly in CNSs by more than 2-fold. For those motifs, it is important to know that, in every case, complement and reverse complement were enriched to an equal degree (by chi square). The 5-mer within the G-box, 5′ACGTG is more detectable than the G-box itself, and is more detectable than any of the 11 G-box derivatives. For example, the most CNS-enriched G-box derivative, 5′CACGTGGC and its reverse complement, was among the least detectable at 26%; we conclude that this 8-mer motif contains alternative bp substitution sequences that still function even when mutated for the majority of similar sequences, and we draw a similar conclusion for most of the G-box derivative motifs. Although these particular G-like-boxes may (or may not) be the optimum DNA-binding partner for one or a few protein–DNA interactions, this sequence is really not a motif. Rather, they are each a specific sequence that contains a motif. We suggest that this G-box situation is typical of the generally overlapping, multiple motif data that comprise our current plant motif lists. For example, one such list that attempts to be exhaustive—the 426 regular expression motifs gathered together in the MotifView application in CoGe—fall into many sets of overlapping sequences, each supported by a unique experimental datum. Detectability measures over evolutionary time may help consolidate binding sequences into actual motifs. By this reasoning, the “G-box” is not an actual motif, but a derivative. The actual motif by this reasoning, the core shared by all or most related sites, could be 5′ACGTG because it is the most detectable of CNS-enriched boxes in the “G-box” family.', 'The general aim of bringing together CNSs and motifs or clusters of motifs—and especially ChIP-seq sites (much needed data)—is not even well formulated for plants. We know next to nothing about what proteins actually bind CNSs, how many different binding sites generally occupy CNSs, or if the spacing of sites within or among CNSs is important.', 'Knowing that the predominant reason Arabidopsis CNSs go undetectable is deletion, leading to loss-of-function, is crucial for the intelligent application of a new strategy for enhancer-like site analysis: fractionation mutagenesis. For example, the Br paleohexaploid informs intelligent, hypothesis-driven enhancer experiments in Arabidopsis. Fractionation mutagenesis is exemplified in the GEvo blastn output graphic of figure 3, where the query is Arabidopsis At1G75520, a particularly CNS-extensive gene encoding a RING zinc finger protein of SHI-type. Its 17 CNSs, covering 7.5 kb of chromosome in addition to the 1.9 kb transcriptional unit, have been largely retained in triplicate in Br. However, fractionation has rendered undetectable—probably deleted—a few longer orthologs of αCNSs: those circled in figure 3 are clearly present in At and Br II. The arrows indicate individual sequences in At. If there were a particular RNA-level pattern that was missing or aberrant in Br I and Br III, but ancestral in Br II, the CNS denoted by the rightmost arrow would become a candidate sequence with a hypothesis as to its meaning. Looking further to the right in figure 3, we find that CNSs on subgenome III (Br III) are ancestral, but some CNSs are missing from orthologs on subgenomes I and II. As subgenome III is the dominant subgenome (Cheng et al. 2012), this bias for loss is expected.', 'There will soon be many more orthologous At CNSs when usefully diverged Brassicaceae genomes are sequenced and aligned, and when CNSs obtained from multiple alignment data are merged with our pairwise CNS list. Those fractionated in Br should predominately lose function. It is valid to think of the fractionations following polyploidy in the Brassicas (and probably following other plant polyploidies as well) as deletion machines ideally suited to be used in the procedure of fractionation mutagenesis.', 'Supplementary tables S1–S4 and figure S1 are available at Genome Biology and Evolution online (http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/).', 'This work was supported by National Science Foundation grants DBI 0701871 and IOS-1248106 to M.F.
