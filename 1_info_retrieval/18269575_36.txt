['\n        This work reveals that the woodland strawberry ortholog of the floral activator SOC1 (Fv SOC1) is the general regulator of the photoperiodic development in this perennial short-day plant. It suppresses photoperiodic flowering by activating a major floral repressor Fv TFL1 and mediates photoperiodic signaling to promote runner development through regulating gibberellin biosynthetic genes.\n      ', 'Current address: Faculty of Agriculture, Utsunomiya University, Tochigi 321-8505, Japan.', 'The author responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the Instructions for Authors (www.plantcell.org) is: Timo Hyt√∂nen (timo.hytonen@helsinki.fi).', 'Online version contains Web-only data.', '\n            www.plantcell.org/cgi/doi/10.1105/tpc.113.115055\n          ', 'This work reveals that the woodland strawberry ortholog of the floral activator SOC1 (Fv SOC1) is the general regulator of the photoperiodic development in this perennial short-day plant.

We analyzed the function and regulation of the SOC1 homolog (Fragaria vesca [Fv] SOC1) in the perennial short-day plant woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca). We found that Fv SOC1 overexpression represses flower initiation under inductive short days, whereas its silencing causes continuous flowering in both short days and noninductive long days, similar to mutants in the floral repressor Fv TERMINAL FLOWER1 (Fv TFL1). Molecular analysis of these transgenic lines revealed that Fv SOC1 activates Fv TFL1 in the shoot apex, leading to the repression of flowering in strawberry. In parallel, Fv SOC1 regulates the differentiation of axillary buds to runners or axillary leaf rosettes, probably through the activation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes. We also demonstrated that Fv SOC1 is regulated by photoperiod and Fv FLOWERING LOCUS T1, suggesting that it plays a central role in the photoperiodic control of both generative and vegetative growth in strawberry. In conclusion, we propose that Fv SOC1 is a signaling hub that regulates yearly cycles of vegetative and generative development through separate genetic pathways.', 'gibberellin', 'short-day', 'long-day', 'RNA interference', 'high-pressure sodium']
