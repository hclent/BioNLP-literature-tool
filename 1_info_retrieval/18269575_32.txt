['\n        Significance\n        In many eukaryotes, reproduction involves contributions of genetic material from two parents. At some genes there are parent-of-origin differences in the expression of the maternal and paternal alleles of a gene and this is referred to as imprinting. The analysis of allele-specific expression in several maize hybrids allowed the comprehensive detection of imprinted genes. By comparing allelic expression patterns in multiple crosses, it was possible to observe allelic variation for imprinting in maize. The comparison of genes subject to imprinting in multiple plant species reveals limited conservation for imprinting. The subset of genes that exhibit conserved imprinting in maize and rice may play important, dosage-dependent roles in regulation of seed development.\n      ', 'Edited by Steven E.

The subset of genes that exhibit conserved imprinting in maize and rice may play important, dosage-dependent roles in regulation of seed development.', 'In plants, a subset of genes exhibit imprinting in endosperm tissue such that expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. Imprinting may arise as a consequence of mechanisms for silencing of transposons during reproduction, and in some cases imprinted expression of particular genes may provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species. Separate mechanisms for the origin of imprinted expression patterns and maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the targets of imprinting in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes, providing a comprehensive analysis that allows evaluation of imprinting at more than 95% of endosperm-expressed genes. We find that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on a subset of these genes that had >90% expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10% of imprinted genes show evidence of allelic variation for imprinting. A comparison of imprinting in maize and rice reveals that 13% of genes with syntenic orthologs in both species exhibit conserved imprinting. Genes that exhibit conserved imprinting between maize and rice have elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios compared with other imprinted genes, suggesting a history of more rapid evolution. Together, these data suggest that imprinting only has functional relevance at a subset of loci that currently exhibit imprinting in maize.']
